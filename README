This is a proof of concept of a status handler for workflows:

To try it out:
1. In a shell run `make start-temporal-cluster` to start a local Temporal cluster. The frontend is available at http://localhost:7233 and the UI is available at http://localhost:8233.
2. In another shell run `make start-worker` to start the worker. For simplicity it is a worker both of worklows and activities.


Pending application:
1. Typed custom search attributes
2. Improve code and examples (different workflows?)
3. Improve README
4. Finish repo
5. Apply
