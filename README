This is a proof of concept of a status handler for workflows:

To try it out:
0. Install Temporal cli. Run `make install-temporal-cli`
1. Open a shell and start the Temporal cluster by running: `make start-temporal-cluster`. The frontend is available at http://localhost:7233 and the UI at http://localhost:8233.
2. In a new shell run `make start-worker` to start the worker. For simplicity it is a worker both of worklows and activities.
3. In a new shell start a workflow by running `make run-workflow`
4. Access the UI at http://localhost:8233. You should see the workflow running and if you access it, you will see that the GreetingActivity failed.
5. Try to send a signal called `retry` (without a body) and see the GreetingActivity runs again (and fails again)
6. Try to send a signal called `skip` (without a body) and see the workflow completes successfully (not running the GreetingActivity again)
7. Start a new workflow in the shell
8. Check the GreetingActivity has failed again
9. Go to the activity implementation and make it not return nil (no error)
10. Kill the worker (CTRL+C) and start it again
11. Send a `retry` signal to the workflow
12. See that the WF has run the GreetingActivity again (this time successfully) and it has completed.
